# Covid-19Dath_prediction
We can use historical data on covid-19 cases and deaths to predict the number of deaths in the future. So if you want to learn how to predict covid-19 deaths with machine learning, this project is for you. In this project, I will take you through the task of Covid-19 deaths prediction with machine learning using Python.
